# Next.js Template Review

After reviewing the codebase, here are the main findings and fixes applied:

1. **Language Attribute Fix**
   - Fixed hardcoded "cs" language in layout.tsx to use dynamic locale value
   - This ensures proper language attribution for different locales

2. **OpenGraph Metadata Improvements**
   - Corrected siteName format in layout.tsx
   - Removed invalid concatenation in URL structure
   - Fixed metadataBase URL formation

3. **Internationalization Setup**
   - The next-intl setup appears correct
   - Proper middleware configuration is in place
   - Locale handling in routes is implemented correctly

4. **Component Structure**
   - Layout follows Next.js 13+ conventions
   - Server and client components are properly separated
   - Image optimization is correctly implemented

5. **Routing System**
   - Dynamic route handling for [locale] is properly configured
   - generateStaticParams is implemented correctly
   - Path handling follows Next.js best practices

The template appears to be functioning correctly with the applied fixes. The structure follows Next.js 13+ best practices and includes proper handling of internationalization, metadata, and routing.
